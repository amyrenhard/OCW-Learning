##Problem 1
##Write a program that does the following in order:
##Asks the user to enter his/her date of birth.
##Asks the user to enter his/her last name.
##Prints out the user’s last name and date of birth, in that order.
##An example of an interaction with your program is shown below (the words printed in blue are from the
##computer, based on your commands, the words in black are a user’s input – the colors are simply here to
##help you distinguish the two components):
##Enter your date of birth:
##**01/26/32
##Enter your last name:
##**Grimson
##Grimson 01/26/32
